Shading
 - The computation of how much light is being reflected from an incident direction to an output direction
 - A mathematical model for simulating light-matter interactions
 - There are generally different shading equations/programs for each unique type or category of material

Diffuse objects reflect light in all directions regardless of incoming light direction. For specular
surfaces, this is not the case.

Phong Specular Model:
 - Used to compute glossy surfaces

To compute brightness:
 - How much light falls on the surface and the point being measured?
 - How much light is reflected at this point in the viewing direction?

For specular surfaces (like a mirror) the amount of light being reflected depends on the viewing angle.


Shaders are only the computation of the reflection of light at the surface of an object - the way light
is transported between objects is a different problem called light-transport.
