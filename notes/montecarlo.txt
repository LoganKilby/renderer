Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo Approximation
 - (1 / N) * E(x)
 - where E(x) is the sum of the randomly selected sample x

In raytracing, pixels are treated as small grid surfaces. It is an intractable problem to compute the
amount of lightreflected across the pixel surface. 
Using the MonteCarlo method, the pixel is sampled in random places across the surface to
average it's color using ray tracing.
 - (1 / N) * S(L(Xn)) where S is the sum of the average color L at each pixel X for all N pixels

The rate of convergence (arrival at the exact answer) is slow for this method. Every sample returns
a different result since the pixels are chosen at random (in a defined range of pixels, say in a 16x16
pixel grid), and you need twice as many samples to minimize the error by a factor of two.

Biased vs Unbiased and Estimators
The estimator is the value of the approximation as the number of samples goes to infinity.
In an biased system, the estimated approximation DOES NOT converge to the exact answer given enough
samples (or at infinity).
In an unbiased system, the estimated approximation DOES equal the exact answer given enough samples
